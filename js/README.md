# My Neighborhood Map

This map shows places near my home that my son and I visit regularly.

To see a snippet of information about the suburb (locality) where a place is located,
click a marker or the location's name in the Locations sidebar list.

The Locations sidebar list can be filtered based on title with the text input field.
